### RETRO_TAPPING Retrofittings 

This fork contains a fix for dropped characters when key rolling and the edition of RETRO_TAPPING_TIMEOUT.  
It has exclusively been tested with the setting RETRO_TAPPING enabled and 
with all modifier keys being invoked by dual funtion keys (the layout below).
No testing has been done on RETRO_TAPPING_PER_KEY, AUTO_SHIFT_ENABLE, or RETRO_SHIFT.

Please see the other branches in the repository for the isolated modifications.

## Key Roll Fix

Fix the condition found with RETRO_TAPPING enabled when key rolling. The dual function
keys's retro tap keycode is not fired when a different key has been released
between the dual function keys's down and up events.

Any modifiers held during the key down event of a dual function key will be applied if/when the
retro tap keycode is sent.

## RETRO_TAPPING_TIMEOUT

With RETRO_TAPPING enabled, holding and releasing a dual function key without pressing another key will result
in the key's tap keycode being sent even if outside the tapping term. With RETRO_TAPPING_TIMEOUT enabled as well,
holding a dual function key for longer than the specified timeout duration will result in no keycode being sent
when the key is released.

This setting can be enabled in 'keyboards/<>/keymaps/config.h' with RETRO_TAPPING
and takes an integer that is the timeout duration in milliseconds.

```c
#define RETRO_TAPPING_TIMEOUT 500
```

### Aside

I use a tapping term of 180ms on my bottom-row-mods and 150ms on the thumb keys.
This will likely work for RETRO_TAPPING_PER_KEY.
